     * to make this an abstract class, that forwards everything to some

     * its own {@code RequestResult}, with the correct type.  A {@code RequestResult}
     * object would represent the result of one HTTP request on the wire, so there
     * could be a few in case of a authentication handshake, or a redirect, etc.
     * 
     * TODO: Actually, an even better approach would be to say that the function
     * {@code http:send-request} must send exactly only ONE request on the wire.
     * Authentication back-and-forth, redirects, and other alike would then be
     * implemented in XSLT and XQuery themselves, by providing a library on top
     * of the extension function (taking some configuration XML element, with
     * options, function items, etc., saying what to do in case of such events.
     * 
     * That is, keep the extension implementation as a minimum, and share all
     * the rest in XQuery and XSLT.  That would simplify the specification as
     * well, and increase compatibility.
